Here's a brief discription about "STARSET" :
Starset is a simple game of a lost spaceship tries to find its way but entering into infinite wave of space rocks.
The player can control the spaceship by keyboad's arrows with infinite amount of bullets.
The player has 3 lives .. which decreases by hitting "touching" a rock.
The game ends when the players lose all of their lives .
I sincerely apologize if there is bugs found by you playing the game ; I have tried it multiple time and it ended successfully .
I had fun of this experience trying for the first time to complete a full project .
I think you will find the blocks of code a little bit messy ; I do not really know how to handle tiding the graphical codes 
pretty well. I really hope this is not a point against my work .
Thank you for your time .
